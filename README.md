# argo-101 - Declarative Continuous Delivery for Kubernetes

Argo was named after the ship Argo in Greek mythology, which carried the Greek mythological hero Jason and the Argonauts on their quest for the Golden Fleece. An argonaut also happens to be a species of pelagic octopuses, and so we used an octopus as our open source project mascot. Argonauts are groups of hard-working deep-sea octopuses that traverse undersea and perform numerous tasks critical to marine biology. — Jesse Suen, Argo Project Lead, Co-founder, and CTO — Akuity
